# odin-recipes
This project will be the first webpage project that I create. The webpage will consist of a main index page with a few links to recipes. Very simple stuff, but the start of a larger journey for me in web development. Once I finish this project I will have demonstrated how to use ordered and unordered list as well as link other pages to the main index.html page.
